   - Any supplementary scripts, assets, or tweaks included within the provided folder structure.

3. The rights granted in this license apply globally and are not limited by jurisdiction. You are free 
to use, edit, remix, redistribute, or incorporate the Software into other projects or packages, 
whether commercial or non-commercial in nature.

4. Modding, tweaking, or optimizing games is a community effort. By using this Software, you agree

In other words, if your game crashes, your saves get corrupted, system personalisiation settings get changed,  
crucial system components like the autostart folder get changed, startup settings get manipulated, your framerate drops, or your PC 
spontaneously combusts (unlikely, but still), you agree that the author is not liable for any damages.

damage, or other liability—whether in an action of contract, tort, or otherwise—arising from, 
out of, or in connection with the Software or the use or other dealings in the Software. 
This is standard practice in open-source licenses to protect creators.

8. By installing, integrating, or otherwise using the Software, you agree to the terms and 
conditions outlined above. If you do not agree to these terms, you should not use the Software.
